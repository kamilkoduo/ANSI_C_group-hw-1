/** The array_changer function
 *  just to demonstrate how to work with returning of array from function
 *
 *  1) C language doesn't have strings
 *  2) array in a C language is just a segment of memory
 *  3) C lang doesn't have ability to pass array as parameter in a function
 *  4) we suppose that you don't know about memory allocation through pointers
 *
 *  so, we provide you simple demo function which change 'c' char in input array
 *  	input parameter: constant array of chars
 *  	output: pointer to memory segment in which resulting array starts
 *
 *  	extra stuff: we provide you three define macros in task.h.
 *  		you can use them in your solutions
 *  		if you don't want to use them please, don't delete them - somebody may use it
 *
 *  please look for test case for array_changer function in test_task.c
